            <p><p>Initial purpose of position was to revitalize the entire frontend of Intuit Live Community. No RoR/coffee experience. First code to production in 1 week (company average for new employee was 3 months). Refactored and deployed new frontend within 1.5 months (performance, cleanliness, new design, xHTML/css3/JS/SEO best practices, mobile-ready). Began working on other parts of application prior to contract ending. Continued fronted role for about a year, shifts in team composition over time left some holes in backend that needed to be filled. I offered my assistance to fill more and more backend role tasks as needed. RoR/coffee expertise was growing rapidly and I really started to flourish on the team, bringing my full-stack abilities front-and-center. Became very fond of unit testing, automation, and generally writing well-maintainable, clean code that can be easily reviewed by peers and explained without comments. Oversaw shift from angular JS to react JS. Oversaw git branching strategy revitalization (using Atlassian techniques and git libraries to create a more continuousdeployment style of branching optimized for rollbacks and quick bug fixes). Live Community was looking to revitalize their embedded widget platform, removing all iFrames and adopting node/react technology stack. Removing iFrames allows for analytics and UX to flow seamless into Live Community widgets from parent applications (TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mint, Salesforce). Heavily involved in technology stack decisions, took a great risk in undertaking this task for 2016-2017 tax season and committed to deliver (with ample testing). Became fluent in NPM and node and general JS MVC framework technologies and packages. During this position I really realized what the future of Web Development would bring: business logic 100% controlled on frontend MVC, small microservice-based backend API to return simple JSON strings to MVC.</p>
